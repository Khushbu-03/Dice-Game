# Dice-Game
Client server game using socket programming and fork in c. 
This is a project in which I used C to create a dice game which uses client and server interaction. I used sockets in c for the interaction between server and client.

The server process and the client process will run on two different machines and the communication between the two processes is achieved using Sockets.
The client process will need IP and Port number of Server process in order to connect to server socket.
